# This application is developed to streamline the integration of Brokenithm with USB devices.
The application offers two key features: 
- The 'Detect Devices' option assists in setting up adb reverse.
- The 'Start Brokenithm Server' option opens the server interface configured with TCP for reduced latency when connected via USB.

Simply ensure that USB debugging is enabled on your device to complete the process successfully!
